    <h1>These are my hobbies!</h1>
        <hr/>
        <p>I'll divide it into two parts:</p>
        <p>The <b>first</b> one are the hobbies that <b>makes me money</b> on the side,</p>
        <p>and the <b>second</b> one are the hobbies <b>that just for fun</b>.</p>
        <hr/>
    <h2>Hobbies for Money</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Macro Games</li>
                <ul><i>- I make some macro to those games that have repetitive movements and sell the script or the items to other players.</i></ul><br>
            <li>Cryptocurrency and Forex Trading</li>
                <ul><i>- As the basic concept of basic supply and demand, <b>"You buy low, you sell high"</b> (Trade at your own risk, I am not a financial advisor).</i></ul><br>
            <li>Programming</li>
                <ul><i>- Given that it is my college program, it started literally just a hobby but I enhance my skill more to the point where it actually helps me to land a job.</i></ul>
        </ul>
        <hr/>
    <h2>Hobbies for Fun</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Running</li>
                <ul><i>- I'm a big fan of walking, jogging, running (whatever you call it) as I like to stay healthy and fitted. I also join marathons/fun runs.</i></ul><br/>
            <li>Eating Fruits</li>
                <ul><i>- Whether you believe it or not, as a 20 yrs old, I actually prefer a lot of eating fruits than other snacks like chips and fast food.</i></ul><br/>
            <li>Learning New Language</li>
                <ul><i>- Aside from learning new language in computer, I'd like to also learn new 'human' language, what I had in mind is learning some Nihongo where it will be the same level as my english. </i></ul><br/>
            <li>Solving Mathematical Questions</li>
                <ul><i>- I like math a lot even I was a kid, I really do believe that math really helps us in our daily life, we just don't notice it but it's there. </i></ul><br/>
        </ul>
